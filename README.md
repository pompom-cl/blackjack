## What is this?
my cs50p final project's repository.

This project is a simple implementation of a command-line Blackjack game, where the player competes against the dealer to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.

### Rules:
- Try to get as close to 21 points as possible without going over.
- Kings, Queens, Jacks are worth as 10 points.
- Number cards (2 through 10) are worth their numeric value.
- Aces can be worth either 1 point or 11 points, depending on which helps your hand more.

### Actions:
- (H)it: Draw another card to add to your total.
- (S)tand: Keep your current hand and end your turn.
- (D)ouble Down: On your first turn, you can double your initial bet, but you must draw exactly one more card before standing.
